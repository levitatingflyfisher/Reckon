# Contributing to Reckon

Thank you for taking the time to contribute! This document explains how to report issues, suggest features, and submit code changes.

---

## Reporting Bugs

Before opening a new issue, search existing issues to avoid duplicates.

When filing a bug report, please include:
- Flutter version (`flutter --version`)
- Device/OS and version
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected behaviour vs. actual behaviour
- Any relevant log output (`flutter logs`)

---

## Suggesting Features

Open an issue with the `enhancement` label. Describe the problem you are trying to solve rather than jumping straight to a solution — this helps discussion stay focused.

---

## Development Setup

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd reckon
flutter pub get
```

Reckon uses a local LLM for receipt and expense analysis — no cloud API keys are required. The app runs fully offline. If you are working on the AI capture pipeline, ensure you have the model weights available locally as described in the project README.

To regenerate Drift database code after changing table definitions:

```bash
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

---

## Code Style

All contributions must pass the following checks before review:

```bash
# Format
flutter format .

# Static analysis (must have zero issues)
flutter analyze

# Tests (must all pass)
flutter test
```

The project uses `package:flutter_lints` with standard rules — no overrides. Do not disable lint rules without a well-reasoned justification in the PR description.

---

## Testing

- Every new feature must include tests.
- Bug fixes should include a regression test where feasible.
- Tests live in `test/` and mirror the `lib/` structure:
  - `test/unit/` — domain entities, repositories, services
  - `test/widget/` — presentation layer widgets and screens
- Repository tests use an in-memory SQLite database (no mocking needed thanks to Drift's `NativeDatabase.memory()`).

---

## Pull Request Workflow

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/my-feature
   ```
2. Make your changes, following the code style rules above.
3. Open a PR against the `main` branch with a clear description of what changed and why.
4. Link any related issues in the PR description (`Closes #123`).

PRs that fail `flutter analyze` or `flutter test` will not be merged.

## Architecture Notes

Reckon uses clean architecture with a feature-based folder layout. When adding a new feature:

1. Create a directory under `lib/features/<feature-name>/` with three sub-directories:
   - `domain/` — define entity classes and an abstract repository interface
   - `data/` — implement the repository using a Drift DAO
   - `presentation/` — screens, widgets, and Riverpod controllers/providers

2. Add database tables to `lib/services/database/tables.dart` and a new DAO under `lib/services/database/daos/`.

3. Run `dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs` to regenerate Drift code.

4. Register the new repository provider in `lib/core/providers/repository_providers.dart`.

5. Add routes in `lib/app/router.dart`.
